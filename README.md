# Welcome to Cloud101

## Good to know

The branch `cloud-101` is the entrypoint for your journey if you are new to most (cdk or AWS) stuff.

If you want to deploy this branch to AWS using CDK you need to do a few things:

* Make sure you're logged in to the AWS CLI
* Make sure you have a AWS account that can use CDK and create the following resources (least privilege or have admin access):
  * Cognito
  * API Gateway
  * Lambda Function

## Parameters

**After deploying you need to update the `index.html` file with the output that is provided in the CDK console**

The `index.html` file contains three parameters on top of the file:

```html
  <script>
    const region = 'US-WEST-2';
    const apiEndpoint = 'https://3qidpu1xzl.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/';
    const userPoolClientId = '3ab3raemboe43nafr3m19j24gn';
  </script>
```

The region is defined in `bin/cloud-101.ts` and can be changed but then needs to be changed in both places.

The other parameters are CFN Output parameters and can be found in the terminal after executing cdk deploy.

If you already closed that terminal they are available as outputs in Cloudformation for the CognitoApigatewayLambdaStack stack that was created.
